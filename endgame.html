      <h2 id="captain-america-related-thoughts">Captain America Related Thoughts</h2>
      <p>Captain America wielded Mjolnir!!!! That was absolutely crazy. This was a theory which people were discussing earlier. In Age of Ultron Captain America slightly moved the Hammer, but he couldn't lift it, implying that he's almost worthy. This was probably because he knew that Bucky was responsible for Tony's parent's death. But since they reconciled in Endgame, and Cap had come clean, he became truly worthy. </p>
      <p>Sam Wilson is the new Captain America! This was one of the biggest questions. We knew that Cap was gonna lay down the shield in some way or the other. But the title of Captain America would move on. Both Bucky and Sam were contenders, I'm glad that Steve chose Sam. </p>
      <p>I really like how Cap took the hammer back in time. Since Loki had escaped with the Tesseract in 2012, Cap now has the power to get him back. Considering he has is wielding Mjolnir and that he’s out of time, I’m sure Heimdall is watching him and helps him out with a little Bifrost stuff to be able to get Loki. This scene was brushed over too quickly, because there’s so much potential over here. Most probably he resolved any continuity errors. He also gave Thor his hammer back, which is why he doesn’t come back with it.</p>
      <p>I am so glad that Cap finally got his dance. He truly deserved it. It was sort of being hinted towards throughout the film if you think about it. When the first flew to fight Thanos, Cap had the watch with Carter's face in his hand. When he went back in time (2012) and we saw Cap v Cap, the watch came out again. And finally, when they went further back in time (1970), he was in her office and got to see her as well. These were all reminders of how much he truly missed her and wanted to share his life with her.</p>
      <p>Earlier I thought that they might kill Cap. He’s been a big part of the MCU for a long time, and he had to go. Chris Evans can’t be expected to play Steve Rogers for his whole life, he already said he wants to focus on some other genres of movies now. So, in a way they had to take him out. If they don’t then in the future, if a big event happens, its hard to explain why either Captain America or Iron Man aren’t present. This opens up opportunities for new characters and stories to be told. What I didn’t expect is the way they might have done it. I did not expect them to let him live a full life in the past. To be honest, I thought they would do something like that for Iron Man. Not age him, but let him exist in the MCU as a advisory figure for the future Avengers. I guess the roles got exchanged. But I still love it. </p>

      <h2 id="iron-man-related-thoughts">Iron Man Related Thoughts</h2>
      <p>First of all, r.i.p. Iron Man. I was expecting him to Die, but I didn’t expect it to be the way it did. The MCU was in a way truly his story, and it has now come to an end. Idk if you guys noticed this, but during the credits, when all the original Avenger’s names were coming up with their signatures, Iron Man’s was the last. And the last visual we see in the movie, is Iron Man’s helmet closing in a scene from Iron Man. This was truly beautiful because in the MCU started back in 2008 with Iron Man, and the last visual is Iron Man’s helmet closing, as in this chapter of the MCU coming to a close. It was all done so beautifully, it makes me cry. </p>
      <p>I’m gonna be jumping back and forth over here, but that’s because I just saw the film, and this is all too much for me. But during Iron Man’s death scene, Peter comes to him and starts talking to him. This was a recreation of the scene from Infinity War when Peter is about to get dusted away. Loved it. If we’re talking about scenes being recreated, even Black Widows death scene was recreated, but I’ll discuss that later. </p>
      <p>I’m glad that Tony was able to move on and have a family and, hang up the Superhero life for 5 years at least. An interesting thing I found about the conversation between Pepper and Tony, right before he leaves, is that this time, Pepper asked him to. All this time, Pepper had been the one who would ask Tony to not leave, to stay safe. This time Tony was questioning whether he should or not, but Pepper asked him to. This also made the appearance of Pepper as Rescue later on even more believable, because now we are looking at a Pepper who has also matured and understands how some fights are important. </p>

      <h2 id="thor-related-thoughts">Thor Related Thoughts</h2>
      <p>It was understandable how Thor felt mentally and emotionally at the beginning of the film. He feels like a failure. He didn’t kill Thanos before the snap when he had the chance because he wanted Thanos to know who’s killing him and why. It was a selfish reason. And he let down half the universe. </p>
      <p>They finally set up New Asgard, that was pretty cool. But what I wasn’t too happy about was the way they made Thor’s PTSD a joke. I mean, those scenes were funny. Everyone in the theatre burst out laughing when they saw the scene with Korg and Meek as well, but it felt a bit off to me. I mean, I get it, Chris Hemsworth has great comedic timing and he does well with roles like that. That’s clear from his role in Ragnarok and Infinity War, but at the day, the guy is suffering from PTSD. Not every single one of his scenes needed to be jokes. </p>
      <p>I loved the fact that Thor got to speak to his mother one last time. When his mother was murdered in The Dark World, he didn’t get a chance to saw good bye. But now he got to have one last conversation with her with an added bonus… Mjolnir!! This made the fight scenes later on that much more interesting. He now had two weapons and was attacking Thanos with both of them.</p>
      <p>Another thing which I like is that he passed on the title of Ruler of Asgard to Valkyrie. Even in previous films, he has denied the throne because he feels that he is not a king, but a warrior. Which is true. It only makes sense that he wants to pass on the title. What was completely unexpected but surprisingly appropriate is that he joins the Guardians on their journey. Does this mean that we will see him in Guardians of the Galaxy vol 3? I hope so, it makes sense too. Marvel has been wrapping up their solo films in trilogies, and Thor just completed his as well. But his character got a new aura in Ragnarök, almost making it a fresh start. It will be fun to see him in future Guardians movies. Now there will be three people fighting to be the captain of the ship!</p>

      <h2 id="hulk-related-thoughts">Hulk Related Thoughts</h2>
      <p>I loved professor hulk! His character was super fun to watch. Especially when he tried to imitate his 2012-self and tries roaring in New York. Though I feel we didn’t see enough of him. In a way we got much more Banner than Hulk (I hope that makes sense). Even in the final battle, he had limited involvement, considering he’s the Hulk, he should be doing some Smashing!</p>
      <p>Other than that, I thought it was cool. I liked the interaction he had with The Ancient One. Mark Ruffalo did mention that though in an interview last year, so this meeting was sort of expected. She already knew about Doctor Strange, even if he hadn’t met her yet which makes sense, because that means she has been using the time stone actively to do more than just increase her life span.</p>

      <hr />

      <h2 id="black-widow-related-thoughts">Black Widow Related Thoughts</h2>
      <p>I guess we got a greater insight of her character. The Avengers were the only family she ever knew, and she lost them. This made her death even more emotional. I did not expect her to be the one to die though, that was unexpected. You probably noticed this already, but her death scene was mirroring the death scene of Gamora from Infinity War. The same music was used, and the camera zoomed out in a similar way, moving away from the body of Natasha. I feel that they did brush over her death a tad bit too quick, but its understandable, this movie had soo much stuff to show, plus the Avengers still had a mission to finish. Literally half the universe relied on them to complete the mission, and they could not let the Natasha’s death get in the way of that. </p>
      <p>I did like the fact that she became sort of a Nick Fury in the film, organising and coordinating stuff for the rest of the Avengers. She would’ve fir the role pretty well. It was sad to see her go. </p>
      <p>A lot of people thought that she’s safe for sure since there is a Black Widow movie in the works (yes there is), but the movie is going to be a prequel and probably about her time in the Red Room where she learnt to be an assassin. </p>

      <hr />

      <h2 id="hawkeye/ronin-related-thoughts">Hawkeye/Ronin Related Thoughts</h2>
      <p>I really liked Hawkeye’s character in this film as well. Ronin was a much more intense version of him, which I hope to see in the future again. Plus, he became pretty good with the sword. I do wish that I got to see more of him in the final battle as well. To be honest, I feel like I needed to see more of everyone in that final battle, I just wanted that battle to go on forever!</p>
      <p>I really thought that it would have been him though who dies. As soon as I realised that the two of them are going together, I knew one of them was going to die. As he was the most important person for Black Widow at the time. But since Clint already lost his family, Black Widow would’ve also been the most important person in the world for him. In a way it makes sense. I sort of wanted to see Black Widow go on to become the head of Shield or something, but Fury‘s back and she’s dead, so I guess not.</p>

      <h2 id="other-thoughts">Other Thoughts</h2>
      <p>That battle, with everyone there, was unbelievable! I wanted there to be a scene with everyone it there, and they finally did it (even Gamora! But sorry, Vision). That section of the movie is definitely my favourite moment in the entire MCU. Captain America picks up Mjolnir, Thor supercharging Iron Man’s suit (throwback to the OG Avengers), Spiderman activating Insta kill mode on his suit (shit just got serious), Thanos trying to headbutt Captain Marvel (who also just destroyed his whole ship)! It was all too amazing and I never wanted the moment to end. Another one of the things which I really liked was when all the female avengers combined forces to fight Thanos, that was epic!</p>
      <p>Now that the stones are back in their places in time, I’m sure it must have some repercussions. Like what if some alternate reality was indeed formed. I really hope that we get to see them in the future.</p>
      <p>I liked the way they handled Captain Marvel as well. She is an extremely powerful character who needs proper balancing. By keeping her involvement limited, they were able to balance her powers against those of the rest of the Avengers. They didn’t turn her into a Superman. Also, since she said that ‘there are a lot of other planets out there, but they don’t have the Avengers’, does it mean that shes been straight up ghosting Nick Fury all this time. Maybe the only reason she shows up this time is because she probably saw the affect everywhere. Maybe the pager was useless even this time. Wow. </p>
      <p>As always, Scott Lang was amazing. His role was obviously crucial to the film, but his comic relief was much needed as well. Plus, its giANT man is always welcome!</p>
      <p>I feel that when they went back to 1970 and Captain America stole some of the Pym particles, it had an impact on Hank. He has didnt trust Shield, he didn’t want to give them his technology. What if that mistrust stemmed from this occasion. He must have noticed that some of his particles were missing, but he could never locate them, or figure out who has them. That was a failure on his part as well, so he must have been ashamed of it and this, never mentioned it to anyone, hoping that the person who stole them, never uses them. </p>
      <p>I loved how they explained time travel stuff. It doesn’t work the same way as it does in most other movies. You cant just go back in time, change the past to influence the present or the future. Since they established that going back in time works in a very different way, and it doesn’t actually alter the past but makes a new future in which you changed the past, the events of the old movies still stand now. This was something I was worried about. What if they go back in time and change something major, it would discredit that film all together. Like I would never be able to watch the intro to Guardians of the Galaxy knowing that Quill got hit in the face while he was dancing to Come Get Your Love. But that timeline is maintained in a way. It was truly beautifully done.</p>
      <p>I am not sure whether Gamora got dusted or not though. When Iron Man snapped his fingers and dusted away all of Thanos’ troops did he dust away all the people who came from 2014, or did he dust all the people who the Avenger’s were fighting. If Iron Man did the former, then that means that Gamora is gone, but if he did the latter, then that means she’s still there. I really hope she’s still there, because I would love to see her become part of the Guardians again. Nebula would be there as well, and they will get a chance to be badass space assassin sisters. </p>
      <p>Joe Russo’s cameo was pretty cool, and of course that Stan Lee cameo really hit hard; ‘Make love, not war’</p>
      <p>The fact that they ended the movie without any post credit scene truly made this film a proper finale.  </p>

      <h2 id="my-concerns">My Concerns</h2>
      <p>Where did Thanos get that t shirt from on that planet? I didn’t see any stores over there!</p>
      <p>What happened to Vision? I really expected him to come back in this one and reunite with Wanda when she is brought back as well. Shuri recovered quite a bit of him. Even if that wasn’t enough, they did have the mind stone again after the battle, they could have used it if they needed it. Since the stones are back where they should be, and Thanos is gone, maybe Thanos never actually kills him in the past, and he’s still there. I don’t know. I feel that he should be there in the future.</p>
      <p>If Rocket knew that Thanos used the same energy signature was detected 2 days ago, then why didn't he say anything, why did he wait till Captain Marvel showed up? I'm assuming that as soon as the snap happened, Rocket would have tried to track Thanos, he obviously could have recorded the energy signature on Earth, so he could have set up the necessary equipment to constantly look for that signature again. I find it hard to believe that he waited until Captain Marvel showed up just to say, 'the same energy signature was also located on this planet'. You could make the argument that they didn’t have a space ship, or that even if Rocket could have made one, they might not have had the necessary equipment on Earth, but I think that shouldn't have been the case. Considering how Rocket is a genius at constructing these things, I'm sure someone from Nasa could have helped the Avengers out. </p>
      <p>I feel that Nebula should have known that going back in time would cause problems for her. Considering that she’s part machine, and apparently linked to an inter dimensional network of some sorts, she should have realised that the 2014-Nebula will be able to figure out that somethings going on. I’m wondering if she already knew that, but still went with it because a small part of her still wants to please Thanos. That might not be the case, it might be oversight in general, but still, I thought it could have been resolved. I did still think it was a super cool thing to do though. This was not how I expected them to get Thanos to the Avengers. </p>
      <p>Also, what happened with Wakanda? Did Shuri become the Black Panther temporarily (assuming she wasn’t one of the dusted I know the poster had her face in there, but she had war paint on, which she didn’t while being dusted, so what happened to her?)? Or did Okoye (probably not because she was still wearing her Dora Milaje outfit)? But if it wasn’t Okoye, then who could it be? Because when the other Avengers were talking to Black Widow, Okoye provided the update for Wakanda, why didn’t the Black Panther provide it? Or did they just not have a Black Panther anymore? Killmonger did burn all the Heart Shaped Herb. Ugh, so many questions in this one. </p>
      <p>One thing which they will have to do for the future movies is remove the time travel aspect. If they don’t then any problem in the future can be averted or resolved with the help of time travel. I hope they deal with that properly. Since they need Pym particles to time travel, Hank could always say no.</p>

      <hr />
        <p>But these concerns are insignificant. This movie was truly amazing, a perfect ending. Couldn't have asked for anything else.</p>
      <hr />

      <p><b>I wrote this right after seeing the movie, so give me time to process the rest of it so I can write that down as well. But otherwise, if you feel there's anything you want to discuss with me, lemme know. Thanks for making it this far. Also, I know this doesn't look really good right now, but I've got exams going on people! Come on! Give me a break.</b></p>
