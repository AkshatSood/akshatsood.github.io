                  <!-- <p>A self-motivated and highly focused computer science graduate who exhibits widespread competence and charisma in a multitude of activities. Determined to engage completely in a task and see it to completion. Passionate for developing innovative programs that expedite the efficiency and effectiveness of organizational skill, automation and artificial intelligence.</p> -->
                  <p><strong>Hello there! I'm a dedicated and versatile professional with a passion for technology and a proven track record in the realms of machine learning, software development, and cloud computing. As an enthusiastic learner and an advocate for pushing the boundaries of innovation, I've cultivated a diverse skill set through my academic journey and real-world experiences.</strong> </p>
                  <p>Throughout my career, I've meticulously honed my skills in various domains, allowing me to create
                    innovative solutions that seamlessly integrate cutting-edge AI techniques with robust full stack
                    architectures. My journey has been characterized by a continuous pursuit of knowledge, enabling me
                    to stay ahead of industry trends and deliver exceptional results.</p>
                  <p>Having delved into diverse projects, I've had the opportunity to wear multiple hats. My experience
                    encompasses not only crafting high-performing code but also leading teams to success. Guiding and
                    mentoring fellow developers has been a rewarding aspect of my journey, as I believe in fostering a
                    collaborative environment that nurtures growth and creativity.</p>
                  <p>Interacting with clients and stakeholders is second nature to me. I've had the pleasure of
                    translating complex technical concepts into easily understandable terms, bridging the gap between
                    the development process and client expectations. This has allowed me to contribute significantly to
                    project success by aligning technology solutions with business objectives.</p>
                  <p>My journey has also involved consultancy and project management roles, where I've provided
                    strategic insights and direction to ensure the timely and effective delivery of projects. Balancing
                    technical excellence with efficient project execution is a skill I take pride in, and it's one that
                    has consistently yielded remarkable outcomes.</p>
                  <p>As I continue to navigate the dynamic landscape of software development, my passion for AI and
                    commitment to delivering exceptional solutions remain unwavering. I thrive on challenges, and I'm
                    excited to leverage my diverse skill set to tackle new and exciting opportunities in the field. If
                    you're seeking a dedicated professional who can seamlessly blend AI expertise with full stack
                    development prowess, look no further.</p>

                <p>Single-image super-resolution (SR) is an important computer vision challenge that aims to reconstruct
                  high-resolution images from low-resolution ones. Various statistical algorithms were employed for this
                  purpose until deep learning models could be used to address this in a much more efficient manner. This
                  report1 details the research and deep learning models that were used to evaluate their SR performance
                  against benchmark datasets, using common image quality assessment (IQA) metrics such as peak
                  signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), and Blind/Referenceless Image
                  Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE) score.</p>

              <div>
                <p>The goal of single-image super-resolution (SR) is to reconstruct a high-resolution (HR) image from a
                  low-resolution (LR) image. It is a classical inverse problem in computer vision that is undetermined
                  in nature, with no single unique solution. This process is incredibly useful in situations where HR
                  images are required for analysis, but only LR or low-quality images are available; such as medical
                  diagnosis, satellite images, surveillance, astronomical images, and video analysis and enhancement.
                  Super-resolution has widespread application in a multitude of industries. The increase in research and
                  development in this field in the last few years has made this an extremely challenging and complex
                  task efficient and improved its quality.</p>
                <p>There are various techniques that can be used for image super-resolution. These range from classical
                  interpolation-based statistical algorithms to deep learning approaches which employ models such as
                  convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs). This assignment aims
                  to assess some of these single-image SR models using popular benchmark datasets for training and
                  evaluation.</p>
                <hr />
                <p>This report summarises the processes followed to evaluate the performance of the single-image
                  super-resolution deep learning models like SRCNN, FSRCNN, and ESRGAN models against benchmark datasets
                  and classical algorithms, on various scaling factors. Although one of the models trained in this
                  project achieves results comparable to industry standards, computing hardware limitations restricted
                  the performance of the trained models. Thus, in order to improve the quality of models trained in this
                  assignment, a much larger number of generated patches (with rotations) need to be used. Despite the
                  adaptability and versatility of state-of-the-art models used in this assignment, there are still
                  scenarios in which the perceptual quality of upscaled images is lacking. Furthermore, most industry
                  standard models are trained on images downscaled via bicubic interpolation. The applicability of
                  extending this to other method needs to be studied for its potential to increase the models’
                  adaptability to distortions and noise.</p>

                  start of April 2017 to the end of April 2022. In addition to predicting the stock value exclusively
                  using
                  the data
                  provided with the stock, the project also attempts to acquire, process, explore, and analyse other

                  This report summarises the processes followed to predict American Airlines stock's adjusted closing
                  prices for May 2022, using stock data (along with auxiliary data) from April 2017 to April 2022. Data
                  such as stock indexes, technical indicators, COVID-19 pandemic cases, crude oil fuel prices, US
                  airport passenger volumes, and weather data are used to explore relationships with the stock value and
                  underlying patterns, in an attempt to improve the performance of the forecasting model. Although this
                  project achieves good results, further progress can be made by acquiring and experimenting with
                  additional sources of auxiliary data, such as GDP and inflation rates in the US, along with more
                  specific statistics (like load factor, ticket prices, number of flights, etc.) for American Airlines.
                  Additionally, transformations can be applied to the dataset in order to use other models.

                <p>A smart home speaker is a device that allows you to interact with various applications and other
                  smart home appliances in your home, via voice commands. Through voice recognition, these devices allow
                  you to give complex commands to other smart home appliances (such as thermostats, lights, doors, etc.)
                  as well as retrieve information from various sources (such as weather, traffic, news, etc.). Many
                  smart home speakers also have built-in virtual assistants, such as Amazon’s Alexa, Google Assistant,
                  or Apple’s Siri, which can help you with various tasks such as setting reminders, answering questions,
                  and making phone calls. Smart home IoT (Internet of Things) devices such as smart speakers and screens
                  have become extremely common in households. Market penetration for smart home speakers has more than
                  doubled since 2017, increasing from 7.2% to a forecasted 16.7% by 2023. 70% of users who use voice
                  assistants to interact with smart devices use smart speakers to interact with them.</p>
                <p>In order to provide this functionality, these devices are connected to the internet and often send
                  voice recordings of the commands given to the service provider’s servers/cloud networks via the
                  internet (Fig 1). This is done in order to perform real-time speech-to-text (STT) to process the
                  command, but also additional functions such as contextual understanding and improving the performance
                  of voice recognition capabilities.</p>
                <p>In this project, we aim to identify and assess various security and privacy threats to the smart
                  speaker environment and implement and evaluate the effectiveness of defense mechanisms to mitigate
                  these threats.</p>

                  This project identifies security and privacy threats to the smart home speaker environment and
                  evaluates the effectiveness of security measures taken to address these threats. The paper proposes a
                  combination of audio transformation and end-to-end encryption to mitigate the threat of data exposure
                  and third-party data access. This project demonstrates that it is possible to decrease the
                  effectiveness of ML-based models used for data extraction by masking characteristics in the audio
                  files. This process can greatly increase privacy, while only marginally affecting the performance of
                  the speech-to-text models. We have also demonstrated that end-to-end encryption can be used on audio
                  files with no loss of speech information while greatly increasing the security and privacy of audio
                  files.

                <p>Image classification and facial recognition is a challenging, yet widely used problems in machine
                  learning. It has become a part of our day-to-day lives; from face unlock technologies to camera
                  autofocus and QR code scanning. Thus, it is important to explore the various ways of implementing this
                  technology and to find ways to improve its efficiency.</p>
                <p>This project aims to explore various combinations of state-of-the-art feature extraction and
                  classification methodologies to address the image classification problems posed in this assignment.
                  The CelebA and Cartoonset datasets are used for these tasks, which involve gender detection, emotion
                  detection, face shape recognition and eye colour recognition. In order to perform these classification
                  tasks feature extraction techniques like facial landmark detection and embedding are used along with
                  classifiers like support vector machines, convolutional neural networks, k nearest neighbour

                <p>During this assignment, various combinations of feature extraction processes and classification
                  methods were used. Feature extraction is an extremely important step in the process for machine
                  learning tasks in general, but especially for image classification tasks. Without proper feature
                  extraction techniques, too many variables and noise are introduced to the model, which can help with
                  the regularisation of the model, but more often than not, can result in the learning of unwanted
                  features.</p>
                <p>In this assignment, dlib, MTCNN and HaarCC facial detectors were used for feature extraction. Even
                  though state-of-the-art tools are able to accurately detect faces (and other features) in a large
                  proportion of unseen images, they are not able to do so for all of them. It was expected that this
                  problem would be observed with the cartoonset dataset samples, but it was also observed with CelebA
                  samples. dlib had poor performance against the cartoonset dataset; not only was it not able to detect
                  features in about 20\% of the samples, but even the detected features were not accurate. On the other
                  hand, HaarCC had slightly better performance on the cartoonset dataset and was able to accurately
                  extract relevant features. MTCNN was not tested against the cartoonset dataset. Thus, further
                  improvements in feature extraction techniques are required to be able to perform such processes on any
                  unseen image.</p>
                <p>The models used in the tasks produced reasonable results, especially the Support Vector Machines and
                  the Random Forest Classifiers. However, the results produced by the Convolutional Neural Networks were
                  slightly underwhelming, given the potential that these deep learning algorithms have with image
                  recognition. Thus, further work and research is required to improve the architecture and the
                  effectiveness of the CNN used in this assignment. </p>

                <p>Android has become one of the leading mobile operating system platforms in the world. As of September
                  2020, there are over 3 million applications available on the Google Play Store. Considering that
                  applications on Android are available via other sources as well (for instance, torrents, one-click
                  hosters, websites, blogs or alternative app markets), the total number of applications available for
                  the Android platform is much higher. In the android landscape, malware represents a significant
                  proportion of all applications. Various sources estimate between 6-10% of android applications are
                  malicious and potentially harmful</p>
                <p>Due to constant development of new strains and variants of malware, the composition of malware found
                  in realistic settings is invariably evolving. These changes can lead to inconsistencies in the
                  performance of malware classifiers. It is infeasible to repeatedly retrain classifiers on newer
                  strains of malware. This is due to the high cost of identifying and labelling the malware as well as
                  the computational cost of retraining and distributing the updated classifier. Thus, there is a need to
                  model malware classifiers which can stay effective against the evolving malware landscape. This can be
                  achieved by identifying and studying program analysis methodologies in order to create robust
                  abstractions of the applications.</p>

                <p>Android is one of the world's leading tablet and smartphone operating systems. As of 2019, more than
                  1.6 billion devices worldwide support Android. which accounts for over 70\% of the mobile operating
                  system share worldwide. Research shows that the number of total malware by 2020 is estimated at over
                  1.1 billion, which has increased 18 times over the last 10 years. Moreover, there have been an average
                  of more than 10 million new malware per month in 2020. </p>
                <p>As new forms of malware are being generated, it is important to assess whether models which have been
                  trained on older data sets, can effectively and accurately classify newer applications as malicious or
                  benign. An issue in the Android malware classification realm, is that malware classifiers are not
                  evaluated in settings which represent real world deployments. In order to successfully assess the
                  effectiveness of a classifier in a realistic setting, it is important to evaluate the robustness to
                  temporal decay.</p>
                <p>In addition to temporal considerations during classification, the ratio of malware to goodware (or
                  non-malicious) in realistic scenarios should be enforced during evaluation. This ratio is domain
                  specific. Reports suggest that most Android applications are non-malicious.</p>
                <p>Thus, there is an urgent need for robust, efficient and spatial-temporal aware malware classification
                  solutions. </p>

                <hr />

                <p>The project is research oriented and focuses on evaluating various program analysis methodologies in
                  the malware classification realm. To this end, static program analysis algorithms are considered for
                  this project. The developmental scope of the project will cover the execution of control flow analysis
                  of Android applications, generations of graph vector embeddings and modelling of a malware classifier
                  using these abstractions. Furthermore, the project will evaluate the effectiveness of different
                  abstraction methodologies for classification. With a focus on robustness of classification to changes
                  in malware landscape over time, the project will also evaluate the classifier with time-aware data
                  splits. </p>
                <p>There are numerous static program analysis methodologies. However, this project will exclusively
                  focus on control flow analysis and extensions thereof. The methodologies implemented in this project
                  have been selected after careful consideration and are in no way an exhaustive list of approaches.
                </p>
                <p>Due to the research oriented nature of the project, the development of a sophisticated malware
                  detection system is not within the scope of the project. Even though the modelling and development of
                  a classifier is within the scope of the project, the user interface and experience design for the same
                  are not. </p>

                <p>This coursework is set in a modern emulation of the 1980 maze chase arcade game of Pac-Man. In which
                  the main agent (Pac-Man), explores the maze with the objective of consuming all the available food,
                  while avoiding (or attacking) hostile (or frightened) ghosts. Near the corners of the maze are
                  capsules which (on consuming) provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the ghosts, that is,
                  change the states of the ghosts from hostile to frightened. Once Pac-Man consumes a ghost, the ghost
                  returns to the "ghost home", where it is regenerated in its hostile state.</p>
                <p>The aim of the project is to implement a MDP-solver to control Pac-Man's movements and win games in
                  two different mazes (layouts). A win is defined as the state in which PacMan has eaten all the food on
                  the map. A loss is defined by the state in which a hostile ghost has touched Pac-Man. For the project,
                  the score of the game of is irrelevant; the aim is to win as many games as possible. </p>

                  code. Using these values, I was able to get a win rate of 0.603 and 0.600 for smallGrid and
                  mediumClassic respectively; thus, placing within the Epic and Legendary Pac-Man Skill Levels
                  (according to the marksheet). However, due to the low number of runs during the marking process and
                  randomness in win rates, the results during marking may differ. </p>
                <p>Even though an Markov Decision Process (MDP) agent is able to produce high win rates for the Pac-Man
                  environment, it is not consistent. There is a high degree of randomness and variation in this
                  particular implementation of the algorithm. For consistent win rates (or even high scores), other
                  algorithms and approaches (like ad-hoc ghost avoidance) should be explored.</p>

                  designed for the Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust Helping Families Team which are a specialist mental
                  health service for families in complex circumstances. It's a buddy system for the clinicians that
                  allows them to keep track of their appointments, ensure their attendance and ensure the safety of the
                  clinicians when they see their patients by having them check in/out at scheduled times, and notify

                <p>The objective of this project is to produce a mobile app that all members of the team can download.
                  This would need specific features, for example being able to log appointment start and end times,
                  check in and out of appointments, emergency functions allowing contact to be made with the entire team
                  as well as sharing the users live location, reminders for the team to check in on clinician etc. When
                  creating appointments, a buddy request will be sent and the buddy, when accepted, will be responsible
                  for keeping in touch and ensuring safety. It should be an easy way for clinicians in the community to
                  let their team know they are safe, and for the team to be able to act quickly if required.</p>

                <p>While designing the website, consistency and usability where the two main criteria we considered.
                  Each page on the website (other than the home page) is consistent in design. Each of them is laid out
                  as a heading followed by a breadcrumb. The breadcrumbs help with accessibility and tell the users
                  about their current location on the website.</p>
                <p>Each card in the products page has been carefully designed. It makes sure that each card is
                  consistent regardless of the name of the product, the description or even the image size. </p>
                <p>Users can access all options simply from the navbar, except for the reports which can be found on
                  their dashboard. All the necessary information is displayed always to users. </p>
                <p>In addition to this, on completion of any action, or on performing an invalid action, the user is
                  given alerts. Green (success) alerts for successful completion of a task, red (danger) alerts for
                  attempting to execute an invalid task and yellow (warning) alerts in case of Exceptions in the code.

                <p>This is the Second Assignment for Programming Practice and Application (PPA). The game is a text
                  based adventure game called ‘Lambda Corps’. It has various rooms which the player can go through,
                  characters and items to interact with and objectives to complete. The game has been inspired from
                  multiple sources. Some of the more important inspirations for the game are ‘The Stanley Parable’ and
                  ‘Wolfenstein 3D’.</p>
                <p>The game aims to create an interactive and interesting environment for the user. In addition to the
                  many commands the user can use and the special features of the game, I have also incorporated numerous
                  gaming and music references throughout the game.</p>
                <p>The Game ‘Lambda Corps’ takes place in the future, on an Earth in which World War 3 has already taken
                  place. World War 4 is going on, and the 2 sides, the United Federation and the Alliance, are using
                  Cyber Warfare to fight. Due to this changed way of warfare, huge software companies have been added to
                  the army. The protagonist’s name is William Joseph Blazkowicz, and he has just started working at one
                  of these companies called Lambda Corps.</p>
                <p>During the game, you can move through rooms, pick up or drop items and talk to different characters
                  in the game. You are given multiple tasks throughout the game. The next task dialogue is only
                  displayed once you have completed the current task. At any given point, if you forget the task,
                  entering the ‘task’ command will tell you what the current task is. In case you get lost, then you can
                  use the ‘help’ command to print the list of valid commands and the map of the facility, which also
                  shows your current location.</p>
                <p>As the game progresses, so do the days passed since you started playing. This gives the game a sense
                  of progression. Certain tasks will make the game skip a few days, and so will going to the
                  Recreational Room. However there is a limit to the number of days you can proceed to. Once the game
                  reaches 75 days, you automatically lose the game and one of the possible outcomes is printed.</p>
                <p>In the game you meet another employee in the facility, called Stanley. He tells you that the Chief of
                  the Corps might be betraying the United Federation and leaking secrets to the Alliance. You are
                  required to help him and perform the required tasks. You help him find proof of the Chief’s treason,
                  or so he says. To stop the chief from leaking the code for the ‘Reboot Matrix’ of the United
                  Federation Stanley has planted a bug in the Chief’s ‘Superluminal Transmitter’. Unfortunately because
                  of his activities, Stanley has been banned from the facility. Now it is up to the player to activate
                  the bug in the transmitter.</p>
                <p>Once you reach the Chief’s office, you get to know that the Chief thinks that Stanley is the mole.
                  The Chief tells you that Stanley has always been suspicious and now has turned out to be a spy for the
                  Alliance who has already leaked information to them. Because of your interactions with him, suspicion
                  has fallen on you as well. The Chief asks you to prove your loyalty by fixing the bug in the
                  superluminal transmitter, so that he can send a message to the Headquarters. This is when the player
                  is faced with a choice. You can either ‘activate’ the bug or you can ‘fix’ it. As it turns out Stanley
                  was the mole along. When you fix the bug, you end up saving the United Federation and winning the
                  game! If you choose to activate the bug, you end up losing the game. Other than this there are a few
                  secret endings to the game. Once you have collected the CSB from the Server Room, you can actually go
                  to the Chief and give it to him instead of giving it to Stanley. This will end the game as well and
                  you will win since you were able to stop the attack. Also if you pick the rose found outside the
                  facility and give it to Emily, then if you win the game, Emily asks you out on a date.

                <p>For this assignment, we have chosen to simulate the Canadian ecosystem, closely resembling that of
                  the Boreal forest. Animals like bears, wolves, elks, moose, wolverines and salmon populate the
                  landscape along with 2 species of plants. Environmental factors like day and night, seasons, weather
                  and terrain have also been simulated. The simulation contains a total of 3 different zones; the land,
                  the shore and the lake. Bears, elks, moose, wolves and wolverines are land animals and are thus only
                  allowed in the shore and the land. On the other hand Salmon are allowed in the lake and shore and
                  cannot go to the land. </p>
                <p>The animals can be carnivores, herbivores or omnivores. This determines what each animal will be able
                  to eat. Each animal has a breeding season and if they are hibernating animals, then a hibernating
                  season as well. The plants grow differently in different seasons and their growth is affected by the
                  weather. </p>

                <p>This is an app created to explore available properties inside London using the property dataset of
                  Airbnb. It’s designed to be easy to use, and powerful in the data it can display. Creating the piece
                  of software used all the unique talents of Team Hummus, and we split the work evenly between us
                  through GitHub and peer programming at Bush House.</p>
                <p>The GUI carries a modern design with “matte” black backgrounds, bright pink elements and minimalism.
                  Since the application is designed to be for Airbnb, the oﬃcial “Airbnb pink” was used for text and
                  borders to adhere to company design standards. The base idea of the GUI is to disguise the complexity
                  of the backend behind a deceptively simple user interface.</p>
